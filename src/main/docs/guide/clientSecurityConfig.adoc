At this point we will begin adding the security configuration to the React app. Let's begin by creating a `security` directory underneath `client/src`.

[source,bash]
----
~ cd client/src
~ mkdir security
----

Create a file named `auth.js` in your new `security` directory

[source, bash]
----
~ cd security
~ touch auth.js
----
