Next in our `App` component, we need to implement two of React's "lifecycle" methods, which will check whether we are logged in or not.

TIP: See the https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html[React documentation] for more information on the component lifecycle.

In `componentDidMount`, we are using the `Auth.isLoggedIn()` function to see whether we're logged in. Because `isLoggedIn` uses a `fetch` call, which is asynchronous, we're using the `async`/`await` keywords to prevent our check from returning before the `fetch` call completes. Assuming that `isLoggedIn` returns true, we set our `route` state variable to 'garage' - otherwise, set it `login`.

We perform a similar check in `componentDidUpdate`, redirecting to the `login` route if we are no longer logged in.

TIP: For more information on `async`/`await`, see the documentation at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await[https://developer.mozilla.org]
