<1>  We call `e.preventDefault();` to disable the `Login` form's default submit event.

<2> Using `fetch`, we make a POST request containing the credentials entered by the user via the `Login` form.

<3> We chain the `checkResponseStatus` to our `fetch` call to validate that the request was successful.

<4> Assuming success, we add `loginResponseHandler` to the chain to complete the login process.

<5> Any errors are passed to the `defaultErrorHandler` function, along with our `customErrorHandler`.

Note the use of the "custom" handler functions:

1. `customLoginHandler` updates `this.state.route` upon a successful login.
2.  `customErrorHandler`clears the `userDetails` state variable, and sets an error message.

At this point you should be able to successfully login to the application but there are a few more things
to do before we are done.
