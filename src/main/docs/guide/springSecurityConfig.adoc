Now that Spring Security has been added to our application, we can generate the default Spring Security
configuration. The plugin provides a `s2-quickstart` command that will generate a set of domain classes and configuration to get us started.

[source,bash]
----
cd initial/server
----

Then execute the following

[source, bash]
----
grails s2-quickstart demo User Role
----

This should generate the following domain classes:

[source]
----
/server/grails-app/domain/demo/User.groovy
/server/grails-app/domain/demo/Role.groovy
/server/grails-app/domain/demo/UserRole.groovy
----

In addition, the `s2-quickstart` has added an extra configuration file at `server/grails-app/conf/application.groovy`. Grails projects support both YML and Groovy configuration, but YML is preferred. Let's remove the `application.groovy` file and add the following snippet at the end of `application.yml`

[source, yml]
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/conf/application.yml[tag=ssc]
----
