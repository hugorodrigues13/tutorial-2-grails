Along the same lines as the `checkStatusResponse` function, we'll write a `defaultErrorHandler` which will take a JavaScript error object along with an custom handler (to be called after the default error handling).

[source, javascript]
.client/src/handlers/errorHandlers.js

include::{sourceDir}/client/src/handlers/errorHandlers.js[]

The `defaultErrorHandler` function is quite simple: it logs the error to the console. If an additional handler was passed in the second argument,
it will then call that function.
