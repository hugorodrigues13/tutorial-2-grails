In order to implement our authentication we will write several "handler" functions that we can import and reuse throughout our app.

Let's begin by creating a `handlers` directory under `client/src`.

[source,bash]
----
~ cd client/src
~ mkdir handlers
----

Now we are ready to write our first handlers. Create the following two files:

[source, bash]
----
~ touch responseHandlers.js
~ touch errorHandlers.js
----
