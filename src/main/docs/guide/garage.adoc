At this point our login and logout functionality is complete. The last step is to authenticate our REST calls back to our API. This takes place in the `Garage` component, which is shown below.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/Garage.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/Garage.js[]
----
<1> Note the use of the `headers()` function again to return our token-bearing request headers for all of our API calls.
<2> The logout button will execute the `logoutHandler` function when clicked.
Start up the app and verify that you can login and authenticate successfully. Congratulations! You have secured your React app with Grails and Spring Security!
